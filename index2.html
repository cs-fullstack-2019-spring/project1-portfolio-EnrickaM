    <h1> Who am I??</h1>
    <p1>Well  I was born and raised in Memphis,Tn. I have always been into computers since I can remember. Just recently I heard about this
    coding bootcamp in Memphis. Which this is Memphis first coding bootcamp ever.As I found out all of the qualifications to get accepted I
    took a big step to try this new learning experience out. I come from an environment where to many people dont push themselves to do better
    in life. So I am taking a change in my life to be successful as I can.
    I have learned so much about myself doing this experience.I have overcame many of obstacles during this time of my program very blessed and appricative to have
        gone through something like this. </p1>
